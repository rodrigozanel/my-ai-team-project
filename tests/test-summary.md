## Running the Tests

```bash
# Install dependencies
npm install

# Run all tests
npm test

# Run tests in watch mode
npm run test:watch

# Generate coverage report
npm run test:coverage
```

## TDD Approach

All tests are written **before** implementation, ensuring:
1. **Clear requirements** defined through test cases
2. **Comprehensive coverage** of edge cases
3. **Security-first** approach to authentication
4. **Maintainable code** through good test structure
5. **Regression prevention** through thorough testing

The implementation should follow these tests exactly, ensuring a robust and secure authentication system.
